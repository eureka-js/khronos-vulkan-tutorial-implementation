# Khronos Vulkan Tutorial Implementation
This repository contains a **Zig 0.14.0** implementation of the official [Khronos Vulkan Tutorial](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html).

## Purpose
- Intended as a reference for those who have completed the official Khronos Vulkan Tutorial or are already familiar with Vulkan concepts.

## Notes
- This is not meant to be cloned and run without setup. It assumes you've already fulfilled the prerequisites outlined in the official Khronos Vulkan Tutorial.
- This repository is a personal implementation that I use as a remote backup/reference; thus, it may be incomplete or in progress.

## Important
- This does not follow the current version of the tutorial, but rather an older version that can be found in the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20250320170905/https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html). I plan to update the implementation to the new version after I complete the whole tutorial.
